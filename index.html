            <h2>Home</h2>
            <p>
              Here I keep track of my personal journey to start minimizing my use of Google services (amongst others).<br>
              There is a whole world op Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) out there. Sometimes they are even better 
              than the proprietary version but they don't have the money to advertise. <br>
              The amount of choice can be overwhelming. But for me, what seemed to work, is narrowing it down based on:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>the features I most often use,</li>
                <li>the tech I am familiar with and</li>
                <li>the readability of the documentation.</li>
              </ul> 
              This website for example is made and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github</a>  because I am familiar with its systems and 
              I don’t know yet how to host my own stuff. <br>
              And reading into ‘hosting’ and at home servers… I might not. I have to be able to keep track and 
              maintain the solutions I find. Based on my skill level.<br>
              I made this public because I wanted to be able to share alternatives with my family and friends, 
              narrowing down the options for them, brainstorm alternatives, ideas etc with my foss-friends.<br><br>
              Hope you all enjoy the journey with me!<br><br>
            </p>

          <div id="apps" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>
              I will start with the low hanging fruit. Applications that you probably already use or can 
              switch to in 5 to 10 minutes.<br> 
              Then apps that need a bit more time and fiddling to set up.<br> 
              And the last one is actually setting up a little home server... 
            </p>
            <h3>Browser</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, yeah we all know this one.<br>
              <blockquote>Tip: plugins can make your browsing experience a lot smoother. Like an AddBlocker so you don't get scam ads anymore. </blockquote><br>
              There is the option to make a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/account/">mozilla account</a>. I find this very useful to have the same bookmarks 
              on my phone as well as computers.<br>
              It has become even easier  <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox">to move</a> all your stuff from Chrome to Firefox!
              </p>
            <h3>Search</h3>
            <p>In Firefox it is easy to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-your-default-search-settings-firefox">switch</a> to another search engine. I use DuckDuck Go. I have gotten used to it.
            </p>
            <h3>Translate</h3>
            <p>In the browser I just use the DuckDuck translate. <br>
              On the phone I like <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/mobile-apps">DeepL</a>. It also works for pictures. <br>
              You can use it without an account. BUT then you do need to be online. <br>
              Offline translations/glossary is behind a paywall.
            </p>
            <h3>Play Store</h3>
            <p><a href="https://f-droid.org/">Fdroid</a> for the real open source stuff. Generally if I need a simple app I try to find it here first. 
              Like a calculator, tracking weight or food diary, super simple note apps, basic gallery for your photo's, weather.<br><br>
              <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/">Aurora store</a> for all your android needs. It even has banking apps. You can install it trough Fdroid.<br>
              You can make an account with them so when you get a new phone, 
              reinstall Aurora and login, it will be easier to reinstall your apps.<br>
              Or you can use Aurora anonymously.<br>
              <blockquote>Tip: keep a list of all the apps you like (and from which store/website they originate) but not on your phone. Just in case of phone death.</blockquote><br>
              Lastly you can sometimes find apk's via your browser.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>"HERE WeGo: Maps & Navigation" from HERE Europe B.V. for car navigation (also has flitsers &#128248)<br>
              <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd~</a> for hiking, biking etc (best install via FDroid)
            </p>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p><a href="https://ente.io/auth/">Ente Auth</a>. It is encrypted so VERY IMPORTANT to remember your login and have the backup codes somewhere save! <br>
              In order to migrate from you Google authenticator you need another phone (like from a friend) to take a picture of ONE Qr code. 
              Then scan that Qr code picture with Ente Auth on your own device.
            </p>
            <h3>YouTube</h3>
            <p>on the phone I use <a href="https://libretube.dev/">LibreTube</a>. And on Ubuntu I use <a href="https://freetubeapp.io/">FreeTube</a>.<br>
              FreeTube on the phone did not work. The same error sometimes occurs on Ubuntu but a reload fixes it. <br>
              Both Free- and LibreTube block adds and have sponsorship-skip. You can enable this somewhere in the Settings. 
              You can export subscriptions and history from you Google account and <a href="https://docs.invidious.io/export-youtube-subscriptions/">import</a> it in those.[find a vid that goes true this] <br>
              The playlists and history do not sinc but I really don't care about that. I just watch my subscriptions. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Mail</h3>
            <p>I have yet to do this but <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton</a> seems a good and easy alternative. <br>
              Do note that its only 5gb so don't start using it as a drive... </p>
            <h3>Calendar</h3>
            <p>There are soooo many calendar apps, and all work fine for me. So I am gona use the one that comes with <a href="https://proton.me/calendar">Proton</a>.<br>
              I will need to test how easy it is to make a shared calendar or share events. <br>
              And if you don't need to share anything a paper one can work really well too.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Tasks</h3>
            <p>There are soooo many task apps. <br>
              Or you can just use paper but I love how with digital you can make them recurring, get reminders etc. <br>
              I only need it on my phone so I use <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.tasks/">Tasks</a> (Fdroid). They have a nice widget. And it offers to import tasks from google. <br>
              I did find out it integrates with NextCloud but I really don't need it to sinc with anything. A backup now an then is fine.<br>
              Joplin (my notes app) also has tasks but no widgets which makes it unusable for me.  
              I just don't open an app with the mindset of "ah lets take a look at which boring chores I need to do today".<br>
              But I guess a list on the fridge would do the same job and is sharable with the household without a cloud... plus, it looks cute. 
            </p>
            <h3>Time tracker</h3>
            <p>I like using a time tracker for work. This makes reporting at the end of the week easy and
              gives an indication about how long certain tasks give me. <br>
              <a href="https://timetagger.app/">TimeTagger</a> is simple. Has a good report thingy. I can host it <a href="https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger/">locally</a>. Thats all I need. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Drive</h3>
            <p>Now this is the hard one... remember how, on the home page, I was like 'setting up a server is to hard'.. Welp I did it anyways. <br>
              I got recommended <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud</a>. And ow boy, a whole world opened up to me!<br>
              It's like Google Drive and Teams combined! But also MORE. I also use it for Photo's. It has a calendar too...and whiteboard &#129327<br>
              And notes. (but I really like Joplin) <br>
              A lot of stuff to discover and try with NextCloud!<br>
              So I set up a <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/debian-minimal-server/">Debian server</a> on an old white laptop. 
              <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/step-by-step-installing-nextcloud-on-debian-12/">Installed</a> NextCloud and now every-time I get home my 
              pictures and other stuff are safely backup-ed to my cute little home server. <br>
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div id="os" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>
              I have experience with different operating systems on computers but not hands on with the phone or tablet. <br>
              I did do a lot of research so I will describe a little bit of that for the phone and tablet sections.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Computers</h3>
            <p>
              So for work I have to use Window 11. It does the job but is slow and the <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/893162/11-windows-11-privacy-settings-to-change/">privacy</a> stuff bothers me. 
              Then reports came out that my beautiful little pc won't be able to run it fully <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/759925/how-to-install-windows-11-on-an-unsupported-pc/">supported</a>
               or at least it will be just as difficult to set is up as Linux. And THEN I would need to go trough a whole checklist to get a little bit of privacy... So yeah back to Linux<br> 
              I like <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a>. It might not be the best distro but it is user friendly enough for me. Moreover the colour is great.<br>
              Everything worked out of the box for me: Bluetooth, keyboard, mouse, wifi etc.<br>
              <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint</a> is also very user friendly and gives me warm, fuzzy Windows XP feelings. Also great colour and works great on older hardware.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Gaming</h4>
            <p>Yes had to command line install some drivers. But <a href="https://bytexd.com/how-to-install-and-upgrade-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu/">manuals online</a> are great nowadays!<br>
              Moreover, I am not scared of a bit of commandline no more!😎 <br> 
              You can play most steam games using Proton <br>
              Gog games I have yet to try. My games from it do run in the SteamDeck just fine.<br>
              Ea game store... Maybe I just have to repurchase Ooblets but will update this bit later.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Phone</h3>
            <p>
              This is a wishlist item. I would Love to have a Fairphone with /e/OS but first would like to thoroughly test /e/OS on an old phone. <br>
              Because I want to make sure all the necessary apps are supported. <br>
              I read a lot and searched for any os compatible with my old Motorola's but non of them are compatible. <br>
              And building an OS from scratch seems waaay to difficult. <br>
              If anyone has an old <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices">compatible phone</a> plz let me know!
            </p>
            <h3>Tablet</h3>
            <p>
              I don't have a tablet but it was a fun research topic. It seems to really depend on the hardware if it can run a Linux distro.<br>
              See the list here for <a href="https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/">Ubuntu Touch</a> for example.<br>
              I found a good <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface">repo</a> for windows surface.
