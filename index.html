            <p>
              Here I keep track of my personal jouney to start minimizing my use of Google services (amongst others).<br>
              There is a whole world op Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) out there. Sometimes they are even better than the propriotary version but they don't have the money to advertise. <br>
              The amount of choice can be overwhelming. But for me, what seemed to work, is narowing it down based on:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>the features I most often use,</li>
                <li>the tech I am familiar with and</li>
                <li>the readability of the documentation.</li>
              </ul> 
              This website for example is made and hosted on github because I am familiar with its systems and I don’t know yet how to host my own stuff. <br>
              And reading into ‘hosting’ and at home servers… I might not. I have to be able to keep track and maintain the solutions I find. Based on my skill level.<br>
              I made this public because I wanted to be able to share alternatives with my family and friends, narrowing down the options for them, brainstorm alternatives, ideas etc with my foss-friends.<br><br>
              Hope you all enjoy the journey with me!<br><br>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>
              I will start with the low hanging fruit. Applications that you probably already use or can switch to in 5 to 10 minutes.<br> 
            </p>
            <h3>Browser</h3>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/zirafa/simple-website-template">Firefox</a>, yeah we all know this one.<br>
              Tips: plugins can make your browsing experience a lot smoother. Addblocks so you don't get scammed anymore. <br>
              There is the option to make an mozilla account. I find this very useful to have the same bookmarks on my phone as well as computers.<br>
              It has become even easier to move all your stuff from Chrome to Firefox!
              </p>
            <h3>Search</h3>
            <p>In Firefox it is easy to switch to another search engine. I use DuckDuck Go. I have gotten used to it.
            </p>
            <h3>Translate</h3>
            <p>In the browser I just use the DuckDuck translate. On the phone I like DeepL. It also works for pictures. <br>
              You can use it without an account. BUT then you do need to be online. Offline translations/glossary is behind a paywall...
            </p>
            <h3>Play Store</h3>
            <p>Fdroid for real open source stuff. Generally if I need a simple app I try to find it here first: like tracking weight or food diary, super simple note apps, basic gallery for your photo's. Weather.<br>
              Aurora store for all your android needs. Even has banking apps.<br>
              You can make an account with them so when you get a new phone, reinstall Aurora and login, it will be easier to reinstall your apps.<br>
              Or you can use Aurora anonymously.<br>
              Lastly you can sometimes find apk's via your browser.<br>
              Tip: keep a list in your favorite notes app on all the apps you like (and from which store/website they originate)
            </p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>HERE for car navigation (also has flitsers)<br>
              OsmAnd~ for hiking, biking etc (best install via FDroid)
            </p>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>It is encrypted so VERY IMPORTANT to remember your login and have the backup codes somewhere save! you need another phone (like from a friend) to take a picture of ONE Qr code. then scan that one with your own device and the new app open
            </p>
            <h3>YouTube</h3>
            <p>on the phone I use Freetube. and on Ubuntu I use FreeTube. You can export subscriptions and history from you google account and import it in those. <br>
              the playlists and history do not sinc but I realy don't care about that. I just watch my subscriptions. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Mail</h3>
            <p>Proton and then switch some stuff to use that instead of gmail</p>
            <h3>Calendar</h3>
            <p>There are soooo many calendar apps, and all work fine for me. So I am gona use the one that comes with Proton.<br>
              I will need to test how easy it is to make a shared calendar or share events. <br>
              And if you don't need to share anything a paper one can work really well too.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Tasks</h3>
            <p>There are soooo many task apps. <br>
              Or you can just use paper but I love how with digital you can make them recurring, get reminders etc. <br>
              I only need it on my phone so I use Tasks (Fdroid). They have a nice widget. And it offers to import tasks from google. <br>
              I did find out it integrates with NextCloud but I realy don't need it to sinc with anything. A backup nowaday would be fine.<br>
              Joplin (my notes app) also has tasks but no widgets which makes it unusable for me. I need to see it now and then. I am not opening an app with the mindset of "ah lets take a look at which boring chores I need to do today".<br>
              But I guess a list on the fridge would do the same job and is sharable with the household without a cloud...
            </p>
            <h3>Time tracker</h3>
            <p>I like using a time tracker for work. This makes reporting at the end of the week easy and
              gives an indication about how long certain tasks give me. <br>
              TimeTagger is simple. Has a good report thingy. I can host is localy. Thats all I need. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Drive</h3>
            <p>Now this is the hard one... I got recomanded NextCloud. And ow boy a whole world opened up to me!<br>
              It's like Google Drive and Teams combined! But also MORE. I also use it for Photo's. It has a calendar too...<br>
              And notes. (but I realy like Joplin) <br>
              So I set up a Debian server on an old white laptop. Installed NextCloud and now everythime I get home my pictures and other stuff are savely backup-ed to my cute litte home server. <br>
            </p>

          <div id="os" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>
              I have experience with different operaring systems on computers but not hands on with the phone or tablet. <br>
              I did do a lot of research so I will describe that.  <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Computers</h3>
            <p>
              So for work I have to use Window 11. It does the job but is slow and the privacy stuff bothers me. Then reports came out that my beautiful little pc won't be able to run it fully supported ... *** So yeah back to... Linux<br> 
              I like Ubuntu. It might not be the best but it is user friendly enough for me. Moreover the colour is great.<br>
              Everything worked out of the box for me: Bluetooth, keyboard, mouse, wifi etc.<br>
              Mint is also very user friendly and gives me warm, fuzzy Windows XP feelings. Works great on older hardware.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Gaming</h4>
            <p>Yes had to command line install some drivers. But manuals online are great nowadays!<br>
            You can play most steam games using Proton <br>
            Gog games I have yet to try. My games from it do run in the steamdeck just fine.<br>
            Ea game store... Maybe I just have to repurchase Ooblets but will update this bit later. <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Phone</h3>
            <p>
              This is a whislist item. I would Love to have a Fairphone with /e/OS but am first gona thoroughly test /e/OS on an old phone.<br>
              I read a lot and searched for any os compattible with mij old Motorola's but non of them are compattible. I would need to build my own and that seems waaay to dificult. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Tablet</h3>
            <p>
              I don't have a tablet but it was a fun research topic. It seems to really depend on the hardware if it can run a Linux distro.<br>
              See the list here for Ubuntu Touch for example.<br>
              I found a good repo for windows surface.
